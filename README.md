Macintosh keyboard layout for Russian language learners 

Special Features
----------------
Pressing the <option> key + letter gives the unicode character with diacritic for emphasis.  This can be particularly helpful for language learners that need to remember where to place the emphasis.  e.g.: (option+letter => я́е́ё́ы́у́и́о́).  

<CAPS LOCK> quickly switches to Roman characters (makes for quick translations/navigation on a Mac with a non-Russian operating system)

INSTALL
-------
1. Copy the .icns and .keylayout files to your ~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts folder.
2. Restart
3. Go to keyboard in System Settings, select "Input Sources", Click '+", Go to "Others" and select Русский!
