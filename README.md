Macintosh keyboard layout for Russian language learners 

Special Features
----------------
Pressing the <OPTION> key + letter gives the unicode character with diacritic for emphasis.  This can be particularly helpful for language learners that need to remember where to place the emphasis.  e.g.: (option+letter => я́,е́,ё́,ы́,у́,и́,о́,ю́).  

<CAPS LOCK> quickly switches to Roman characters (makes for quick translations/navigation on a Mac with a non-Russian operating system)

INSTALL
-------
1. Copy the .icns and .keylayout files to your ~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts folder.
2. Restart
3. Go to keyboard in System Preferences, select Keyboard, "Input Sources", Click '+", Go to "Others" and select Русский!

Troubleshooting
---------------
If the layout is not visible in the System Preferences, Keyboard, Input Sources restart your Mac
